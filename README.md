# Single-Point-Positioning-using-Pseudorange-Measurements-
<p>
In this project, single point positioning(SPP) function using pseudorange measurements would be performed to calculate the receiver position with the RINEX file, observation file (site0900.01o) and navigation file (site0900.01n). <br>
  The calculation is conducted by MATLAB code.
